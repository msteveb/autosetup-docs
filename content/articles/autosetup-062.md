**autosetup** has seen continuing improvements recently, so I\'ve bumped the version to 0.6.2

Here is a summary of recent changes:

* make-autoconf-h is now deprecated in favour of the more flexible make-config-header
* New: cc-check-defines, cc-check-decls
* New module: cc-lib contains cc-check-lfs and cc-check-endian
* Include files are automatically checked as needed
* Improved documentation
